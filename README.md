# Business_Cases
5 business cases studied and developed with CRISP-DM. Cases range from booking cancellations prediction to basket analysis.

1. Segmentation Analysis for Wonderful Wines of the World. K-means algorithm has been used and four type of customers have been identified.
2. Booking Cancellations Prediction: via Random forest we were able to have 87% accuracy, and via Monte Carlo simulation check the probability of having a certain % of cancellations, hence the possibility of overbooking.
3. Market Basket Analysis for Instacart, an american grocery delivery website. Both segmnetation on orders/customer behaviour and apriori algorithm were used to complete the analysis. A PowerBI dashboard ahs been created to give more insights to the company.
4. Recommender System: for an online UK gift shop. Solutions found for both cold start problem (KNN algorithm) and known users (LightFM algorithm).
